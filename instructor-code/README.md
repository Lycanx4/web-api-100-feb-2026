# Web Apis with .NET 100

Presented by Hypertheory Training, Inc. - Jeff Gonzalez (jeff at hypertheory dot com). February 23 - 25 2026.

## Logistics

- *Class Times* are 9:30 AM - 5:00 PM ET Monday-Friday
    - ~4:30 PM on is one-on-one, or assigned tasks.
- *Lunch Break* is 12:30 - 1:30 ET 

## Communications

- While posting comments, funny gifs, etc. in the Teams chat is encouraged, please try not to ask questions there.
    - The instructor will miss them, he'll feel bad, you'll feel ignored, etc. Unmute! This is not a Youtube Video!
- Likewise, the "raising your hand" thing in Teams is not needed. Just unmute and interrupt me! PLEASE.
- You can send me email both in "the company" and at the address above. *Very* asynchronous.
- If you have something scheduled and you *must* miss a portion of the class, please:
    - Let me know. You don't need to ask permission (though large blocks of time missing might be an issue)
    - Find a buddy, a pal, a friend, or make a new one in class. Ask them to take *simple* bullet-point notes about what was covered while you were gone.
    - I'm happy to go over those things with you after class, or in the morning.

## Setup

The instructor will step you through this, so don't work ahead.

1. Log into your Github account with the default browser in the VM.


```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

And

```sh
git config --global user.email "Your@Email"
```

## Getting Jeff's Code:

Open a terminal here in VS Code, and run the following command:

```sh
npx gitpick -o JeffryGonzalez/web-api-100-feb-2026  ../instructor-code/
```

This will pull down my code into a directory in your profile called "instructor-code". 

It will **overwrite** whatever is in that folder.

But you can copy stuff out of there into your "web api 100" folder, or whatever.

(If you are watching me type this, don't worry, I'll demonstrate.)
