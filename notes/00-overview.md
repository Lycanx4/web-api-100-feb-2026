# Course Overview

## Services 

## APIs

## HTTP-Based APIs

- RFC 2616
- "REST", "RESTful", "Web API"

## .NET and Web API 

- 2001 - .NET with ASP.NET Web Forms and XML Web Services
- 2004 - Ruby On Rails Released (MVC-like web framework)
- 2009 - ScottGu - ASP.NET MVC
  - M - Model "business"
  - V - View "display"
  - C - Controller "input control"
- 2012 - Web API 1.0
  - Originally part of the WCF Platform
  - Moved to ASP.NET at Release
  - Built upon the conventions of ASP.NET MVC, but not the code.
- 2016 - .NET "Core"
  - Cross Platform
  - Open Source
  - ASP.NET "Core" MVC merged the code bases for ASP.NET MVC and Web API

## We are learning ASP.NET MVC 10

- C# 14
- See [.NET Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)
- Using the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` `10.x` Runtime

### Endpoints / Operations

- "Projecting" our business domain into the simple vocabulary of HTTP [[10-http]]
- The "MVC" style with controllers will be called (here) "Controller Model".
  - *Almost* ready to declare this as "legacy" for reasons I will explain, but include, at a non-technical level:
    -  Forces you to organize your code around technical implementation instead of "domain" or business-facing concerns.
    -  Controllers, almost by definition, are a single class with multiple responsibilities. That is, as they say in advanced computer science, "bad".
 -  The "Minimal API" model, introduced in .NET 6, I think - slid into your DMs all sly, like.
    -  Seems to be the future.
 -  We will cover both.

#### Exposing Endpoints

#### Validating Inputs

- Routes / Route Params
- QueryStrings
- Entities/Bodies
  - **note** Big change here with .NET 10 that will be contrary to advice I've given in the past.
